# Risk-based-Stochastic-Control-Barrier-Functions

PM_stochastic solves a reach avoid problem by bounding the risk to a desired value in a high way scenario for a point mass model of
a vehicle in presence of other agents with stochastic velocities. Reachability is enforces by Lyapunov functions.

PM_stochastic_Uni_PF solves a reach avoid problem by bounding the risk to a desired value in a high way scenario for a unicycle model of
a vehicle in presence of other agents with stochastic velocities. Reachability is enforces with the help of potential fields.
